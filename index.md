<p>I now have 10 years experience in the IT Industry and am ITIL certified.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">I pride myself on being a hard worker and fast learner. I enjoy working in a skilled team and jump at the chance to be mentored/up-skilled by my peers on new technologies. At the same time, I can be relied upon to work alone and deliver technical/business requirements on time and on budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">One of my biggest assets is communication, I pride myself on not just having technical skills, but being able to listen to business needs, translate those to technical solutions and work closely and effectively with other areas of the business at all times. Feedback from my peers confirms this.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">My interests/specialties and future career aspirations lie within IT Operations, IT Security, Data Center Operations, IT Infrastructure, IT Projects (management and technical resource), Change and Vendor Management and IT Architecture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">I hope to one day align this with my passions for Motorsports, the Great Outdoors and Music.</span></p>
